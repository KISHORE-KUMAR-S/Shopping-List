# Shopping List

A simple Flutter-based shopping list application that leverages Firebase as its backend for real-time data storage and synchronization.

# Saves the data in the backend but doesn't update in the frontend.
# Use FutureBuilder when you need to load data and display different states based on its loading status, with no additional data processing required.
